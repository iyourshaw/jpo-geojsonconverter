# jpo-geojsonconverter

**US Department of Transportation (USDOT) Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) Joint Program Office (JPO) Intersection GeoJSON Converter**

The JPO Intersection GeoJSON Converter is a real-time validator and data converter of JPO-ODE MAP and SPaT JSON based on the SAE J2735 message standard. Messages are consumed from Kafka and validated based on both the SAE J2735 standard and the more robust Connected Transportation Interoperability (CTI) Intersection Implementation Guide Message Requirements (Section 3.3.3). Message validation occurs simultaneously as the GeoJSON converter converts the JPO-ODE MAP and SPaT messages into mappable geoJSON. The JPO Intersection GeoJSON Converter outputs the resulting geoJSON onto Kafka topics along with an additional property value that defines whether the message is a valid intersection message.

The message validation has been included in the jpo-geojsonconverter in order to prevent too many small microservices from being created. The extent of the current validation that occurs is surface level and is supported by simple verification against a schema. There may be reason to eventually break this feature out into a new, separate repository if more complex validation must be performed.

## 1. Usage Example

The jpo-geojsonconverter is used to convert the ODE JSON output of MAP and SPaT messages into GeoJSON. In order to verify your jpo-geojsonconverter is functioning, you must run the jpo-ode, then the jpo-geojsonconverter, and then send the jpo-ode raw ASN1 encoded MAP and SPaT data.

Follow the configuration section to properly configure and launch your jpo-ode and jpo-geojsonconverter.

Run one of the UDP sender Python scripts from the [jpo-ode repository](https://github.com/usdot-jpo-ode/jpo-ode/tree/dev/scripts/tests) to generate some example MAP and SPaT messages. Make sure to set your DOCKER_HOST_IP environment variable so the script will properly send the ASN1 encoded messages to your locally running JPO-ODE.

Once the message has been sent to the jpo-ode, it will be eventually be decoded and serialized into a JSON string. This string will be placed into the Kafka topics topic.OdeMapJson and topic.OdeSpatJson. The jpo-geojsonconverter will then transform them into geoJSON.

Example MAP geoJSON message (trimmed to a single feature):
```
{  
  "type": "FeatureCollection",
  "features": [
    {
      "type": "Feature",
      "id": 2,
      "geometry": {
        "type": "LineString",
        "coordinates": [
          [
            -105.09115232580189,
            39.59533762007272
          ],
          [
            -105.08992396633637,
            39.595323130058226
          ],
          [
            -105.08960055408492,

            39.59531593005103
          ],
          [
            -105.08766381810617,
            39.5953153000504
          ]
        ]
      },
      "properties": {
        "lane_id": 2,
        "ip": "172.18.0.1",
        "ode_received_at": "2022-10-14T18:41:52.549328Z",
        "egress_approach": 0,
        "ingress_approach": 1,
        "ingress_path": true,
        "egress_path": false,
        "connected_lanes": [
          19
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

IMPORTANT: SPaT geoJSON can only be properly created when corresponding MAP messages have been processed first. A SPaT is not a useful message without the context of the MAP message and is therefore required for the generation of SPaT geoJSON. If a SPaT is generated without the corresponding MAP message, the geometry will be null.

## 2. Configuration

### System Requirements

Recommended machine specs running Docker to run the GeoJsonConverter:
-  Minimum RAM: 16 GB
-  Minimum storage space: 100 GB
-  Supported operating systems:
   -  Ubuntu 18.04 Linux (Recommended)
   -  Windows 10 Professional (Professional version required for Docker virtualization)
   -  OSX 10 Mojave

The GeoJsonConverter software can run on most standard Window, Mac, or Linux based computers with
Pentium core processors. Performance of the software will be based on the computing power and available RAM in
the system.  Larger data flows can require much larger space requirements depending on the
amount of data being processed by the software. The GeoJsonConverter software application was developed using the open source programming language Java. If running the GeoJsonConverter outside of Docker, the application requires the Java 11 runtime environment.

### Software Prerequisites

The GeoJsonConverter is a micro service that runs as an independent application but serves the sole purpose of converting JSON objects created by the JPO-ODE via Apache Kafka. To support these JSON objects, the GeoJsonConverter application utilizes some classes from the JPO-ODE repository. This is included into the GeoJsonConverter as a submodule but the JPO-ODE should also be run independently of the jpo-geojsonconverter. The JPO-ODE is still required to launch Kafka, Zookeeper, the ASN1 decoder and create the required Kafka topics. All other required dependencies will automatically be downloaded and installed as part of the Docker build process.

- Docker: <https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/>
- Docker-Compose: <https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/>

### Tips and Advice

Read the following guides to familiarize yourself with GeoJsonConverter's Docker and the ODE managed Kafka modules.

- [Docker README](docker.md)
- [ODE Kafka README](https://github.com/usdot-jpo-ode/jpo-ode/blob/dev/kafka.md)

**Installation and Deployment:**

- Docker builds may fail if you are on a corporate network due to DNS resolution errors.
- Windows users may find more information on installing and using Docker [here](https://github.com/usdot-jpo-ode/jpo-ode/wiki/Docker-management).
- Users interested in Kafka may find more guidance and configuration options [here](docker/kafka/README.md).

**Configuration:**

The GeoJsonConverter configuration is customized through the environment variables provided to Docker when Docker-Compose runs the Docker built GeoJsonConverter image. You may customize the Kafka broker endpoint.

**Important!**
You must rename `sample.env` to `.env` for Docker to automatically read the file. Do not push this file to source control.

## 3. Installation

The following instructions describe the minimal procedure to fetch, build, and run the main GeoJsonConverter application.

#### Step 0 - For Windows Users Only

If running on Windows, please make sure that your global git config is set up to not convert end-of-line characters during checkout.

Disable `git core.autocrlf` (One Time Only)

```bash
git config --global core.autocrlf false
```

#### Step 1 - Download the Source Code

The jpo-geojsonconverter software system consists of the following modules hosted in separate Github repositories:

|Name|Visibility|Description|
|----|----------|-----------|
|[jpo-geojsonconverter](https://github.com/usdot-jpo-ode/jpo-geojsonconverter)|public|Contains the public components of the application code.|
|[jpo-ode](https://github.com/usdot-jpo-ode/jpo-ode)|public|Contains the public classes and libraries of the jpo-ode used in the GeoJsonConverter.|

You may download the stable, default branch for ALL of these dependencies by using the following recursive git clone command:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/usdot-jpo-ode/jpo-ode.git
```

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/usdot-jpo-ode/jpo-geojsonconverter.git
```

Once you have these repositories obtained, you are ready to build and deploy the application.

#### Step 2 - Build and run jpo-ode application

Navigate to the root directory of the jpo-ode project and run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
docker-compose ps
```

Verify the jpo-ode, kafka, zookeeper, asn1-decoder and asn1-encoder are running before performing step 3.

#### Step 3 - Build and run jpo-geojsonconverter application

**Notes:**
- Docker builds may fail if you are on a corporate network due to DNS resolution errors.
- In order for Docker to automatically read the environment variable file, you must rename it from `sample.env` to `.env`. **This file will contain private keys, do not put add it to version control.**

Navigate to the root directory of the jpo-geojsonconverter project and run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
docker-compose ps
```

To bring down the services and remove the running containers run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose down
```
For a fresh restart, run:

```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose up --build -d
docker-compose ps
```

To completely rebuild from scratch, run:

```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose rm -fvs
docker-compose up --build -d
docker-compose ps
```

## Environment variables

### Purpose & Usage

- The DOCKER_HOST_IP environment variable is used to communicate with the bootstrap server that the instance of Kafka is running on.

### Values
In order to utilize Confluent Cloud:

- DOCKER_HOST_IP must be set to the bootstrap server address (excluding the port)
