Version 1.0.0
----------------------------------------

### **Summary**
The first release for the jpo-geojsonconverter, version 1.0.0, includes a fully functioning GeoJSON Converter for MAP messages and enhanced SPaT messages. The jpo-geojsonconverter consumes jpo-ode OdeMapJson and OdeSpatJson messages and creates ProcessedMap and ProcessedSpat messages. The jpo-geojsonconverter can use local Kafka or Confluent Cloud SASL authentication. Depending on the needs of the user, this release also provides the option to output all ProcessedMap message GeoJSON as well-known text (WKT) based geometry. Read more about the jpo-geojsonconverter in the [main README](<../README.md>).
